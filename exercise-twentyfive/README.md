## Password Strength Indicator

### Base Requirements
Create a program that determines the complexity of a given
password based on these rules:

- A very weak password contains only numbers and is fewer than eight characters.
- A weak password contains only letters and is fewer than eight characters.
- A strong password contains letters and at least one number and is at least eight characters.
- A very strong password contains letters, numbers, and special characters and is at least eight characters.

### Constraints
- Create a passwordValidator function that takes in the password as its argument and returns a value you can evaluate to determine the password strength. Do not have the function return a string—you may need to support multiple languages in the future.
- Use a single output statement.
